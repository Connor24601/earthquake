# Has my home been destroyed by an earthquake yet?
This earthquake awareness web application tries to bring attention to catastrophic events worldwide by bringing a simplistic tone and blunt approach.

It uses the <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/#format-geojson">USGS API</a> to observe location, magnitude, alert level, cdi, and mmi, all of which are measures of severity. The primary statistic I'll be using is the alert level, as it uses the <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/pager/">PAGER system</a> to best quantify earthquakes, taking into account magnitude, intensity, population density, etc. I'll be cross-referencing this with the reported magnitude and intensity. Since the title of this project already deals with structural integrity, the official <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/mag_vs_int.php">USGS magnitude/intensity comparison</a> will help.


Currently this project is still in its very basic stages. Thank you for visiting and reading!
